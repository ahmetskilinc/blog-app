## What is PrismJS?

[PrismJS](https://prismjs.com/) is a lightweight, extensible syntax highlighter that can be used when working with code blocks in markdown files in blog posts.

### Why PrismJS?

PrismJS has many different stylsheets that allow you to extensibly customise your code block styling to suit your style.

## Adding PrismJS

If you havent already read the previous post, do read it if you want to set up a blog like this one. [You can find the tutorial here](/posts/build-a-nextjs-blog-tailwind-markdown)

We need to install `remark-prism`:

```shell
yarn add remark-prism
```

Then we need to tell `webpack` and `babel` to use `remark-prism` as a `remark` plugin.

Add the `remark-prism` to the remarkPlugins array inside `next.config.mjs` and add its import:

```typescript
import remarkPrism from "remark-prism";

// ...
remarkPlugins: [remarkPrism]; /* <-- */
// ...
```

Once you have added the plugin we now need to choose a theme (CSS file) for prism to use. [You can find the stylesheets here](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes). I'll be using [Coldark Dark](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrismJS/prism-themes/master/themes/prism-coldark-dark.css).

Copy the file contents and paste it into a new file named `prism.css` in the `/styles` folder.

Then import `prism.css` in the `_app.tsx` file.

Run your app with `yarn dev` and navigate to `localhost:3000` to check out your new styled syntax highlighting with PrismJS.
