# Build a blog with Nextjs, Markdown and TailwindCSS

## What is Nextjs?

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) is a flexible [React](https://reactjs.org) framework that gives you the **building blocks** to create **fast web applications**.

### Why Next.js?

-   Built in routing (`/pages` folder)
-   Built in server side rendering (SSR)
-   Built in API route (`/pages/api` folder)
-   Large community for support

## What is TailwindCSS?

[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) is a CSS library that allows you to build and prototype applications UIs quickly using utility classes.

### Why TailwindCSS?

-   Utility classes for almost every aspect of web applications
-   Large community for support

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a markup language like HTML but, without the `< >` tags. Instead it uses other symbols such as `#` to define a head, or `-` to define lists. You can see more of the symbols Markdown uses [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

### Why Markdown?

-   Easy to learn
-   Easy to implement into any application
-   Large community for support

## Initialise Next.js App

Run this command in your terminal to initialise a Next.js app:
`yarn create next-app --typescript`

Once the app is initialised, open the folder in your favourite text editor or IDE. I prefer [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

## Clear out the boilerplate

To setup the `_app.tsx` file replace it with the following:

```typescript
import "../styles/globals.css";
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
import Head from "next/head";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
	return (
		<>
			<Head>
				<title>{`Ahmet's Blog`}</title> <!-- Add your page title here -->
				<meta name="description" content="My blog." /> <!-- Add your page description here -->
			</Head>
			<Component {...pageProps} />
		</>
	);
}

export default MyApp;
```

Next we will clear out the `/styles` folder, delete every file except `globals.css`. You can delete the contents of `globals.css` for now.

### Install dependencies

We have 12 dependencies we need to install and setup.

### TailwindCSS

Let's get Tailwind setup. Run these 2 commands in your terminal:

```shell
yarn add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

You should now see a new file in your root named `tailwind.config.js`, Replace its contents with the following:

```typescript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
	content: ["./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}", "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
	theme: {
		extend: {},
	},
	plugins: [],
};
```

Then in your `globals.css` file from earlier, add the following to include our Tailwind styling:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

To test that it is working, you can add the following into the `index.tsx` file, within the return statement:

```html
<h1 className="text-3xl font-bold underline"> Hello world! </h1>
```

Then run: `yarn dev` and navigate to `localhost:3000` to check it is working.

### Add Markdown/MDX

To add Markdown parsing to out application we'll be using a few packages, lets add them with the following command in our terminal:

```shell
yarn add @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react @next/mdx gray-matter axios remark-frontmatter
```

Once you've added the packages. We need to modify the `next.config.js` file. Delete it's contents and replace it with the following:

```typescript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
import remarkFrontmatter from "remark-frontmatter";

export default {
	webpack: (config, options) => {
		config.module.rules.push({
			test: /\.mdx?$/,
			use: [
				options.defaultLoaders.babel,
				{
					loader: "@mdx-js/loader",
					options: {
						providerImportSource: "@mdx-js/react",
						remarkPlugins: [remarkFrontmatter],
					},
				},
			],
		});

		return config;
	},
	reactStrictMode: true,
	swcMinify: true,
	pageExtensions: ["js", "jsx", "ts", "tsx", "md", "mdx"],
};
```

and rename it from `next.config.js` to `next.config.mjs`

Next we will need a file to find and parse all of the post files we create in the `/pages/posts` folder. Create a folder in your root named `utils` then add a file `getPosts.js` with the following:

```javascript
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";
import matter from "gray-matter";

export const getPosts = (pageIndex) => {
	const dirFiles = fs.readdirSync(path.join(process.cwd(), "pages", "posts"), {
		withFileTypes: true,
	});

	const posts = dirFiles
		.map((file) => {
			if (!file.name.endsWith(".mdx")) return;

			const fileContent = fs.readFileSync(
				path.join(process.cwd(), "pages", "posts", file.name),
				"utf-8"
			);
			const { data, content } = matter(fileContent);

			const slug = file.name.replace(/.mdx$/, "");
			return { data, content, slug };
		})
		.filter((post) => post);

	return posts;
};
```

What this file does is gets all of the files within `/pages/posts` and if they end with `.mdx` it will return it in an array of posts with its data, content and a slug for it.

### Lets list all of our posts

First create the `/pages/posts` folder. Then create a file inside it, call it `first-post.mdx`.

Inside the post file add the following:

```markdown
---
title: Building a blog
author: Authors Name
category: Tutorial
tags: nextjs, tutorial, typescript
publishedOn: August 17 2022
---

# Look ma' I'm building a blog

## My first post!
```

To test this now, we can navigate to `localhost:3000/posts/first-post`. You should see your markdown file presented in HTML.

### Listing the posts in `index.tsx`

First at the top of the `index.tsx` file lets add our imports:

```typescript
import type { GetServerSideProps, NextPage } from "next";
import type { Post } from "../types/Post";
import { getPosts } from "../utils/getPosts";
```

We need to create a `Post` type for out posts. So create a new folder `types` in our root, then create a file `Post.ts` with the following:

```typescript
export type Post = {
	data: {
		title: string;
		author: string;
		publishedOn: any;
		category?: string;
		tags: string[];
	};
	content: any;
	slug: string;
};
```

At the bottom of the `index.tsx` file lets add a `getServerSideProps` function:

```typescript
export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async () => {
	try {
		const posts = getPosts();

		return {
			props: {
				posts,
			},
		};
	} catch (error) {
		console.error("Error", error);
		return {
			notFound: true,
		};
	}
};
```

Not above the `NextPage` component, we need to define the type for out `Props`. Add the following:

```typescript
type Props = {
	posts: Post[];
};
```

Then we need to inject our props into the index page by adding it:

```typescript
// Replace this line in index.tsx
const Home: NextPage<Props> = ({ posts }) => {
	return <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold underline"> Hello world! </h1>;
};
```

To list the posts, we need to `map` over our `posts` array. To do this we replace our return statement with the following:

```typescript
return (
	<>
		{posts.length > 0 ? (
			posts.map((post) => {
				return (
					<div className="my-11" key={post.data.title}>
						<Link href={`/posts/${post.slug}`}>
							<a className="hover:underline">
								<h2 className="text-xl">{post.data.title}</h2>
							</a>
						</Link>
					</div>
				);
			})
		) : (
			<p>no posts</p>
		)}
	</>
);
```

Make sure to add `import Link from "next/link";` to the top of the file to import the `next/link` component.

Navigate to `localhost:3000` to see a list of your posts. There should only be 1 at the moment. Try clicking it to navigate to the post!

### Adding styling using TailwindCSS

First run `yarn add @tailwindcss/typography` to add TailwindCSS Typography which allows us to style our blog page without adding classes everywhere.

Then add `require("@tailwindcss/typography")` to the `tailwind.config.js` file inside the `plugins` array. This tells tailwind that we intend on using this plugin.

In order to add the styling we're going to create a layout file which wraps around our post.

In your root create a folder named `layout` and create a file inside `PostWrapper.tsx` with the following content:

```typescript
import { FunctionComponent, ReactNode } from "react";

type Props = {
	children: ReactNode;
};

const PostWrapper: FunctionComponent<Props> = ({ children }) => {
	return <article className="prose prose-stone prose-invert">{children}</article>;
};

export default PostWrapper;
```

Then we need to add it to our .mdx post file. (You will need to do this for every post you create).

```markdown
---
title: Building a blog
author: Authors Name
category: Tutorial
tags: nextjs, tutorial, typescript
publishedOn: August 17 2022
---

import PostWrapper from "../../layout/PostWrapper";

<PostWrapper>

# Look ma' I'm building a blog

## My first post!

</PostWrapper>
```

We also need to tell Tailwind that we have another folder we want it to check for styling. Replace `content` array inside `tailwind.config.js` with: `"./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}", "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}", "./layout/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",`

As you can see above we're wrapping the content part of the `.mdx` file with a component.

If you now navigate to `localhost:3000/posts/first-post` it should have some styling applied to it.

### Add better syntax highlighting
